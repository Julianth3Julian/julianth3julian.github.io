### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3 part 2 was one of my favorite labs because it felt like the first real lab and was the first point I was a little challenged. It also incorporated my name Julian which made me happy to do it. I wrote a math sequence that found the number of days between two user input days.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5 part 2 was another one of my favorite labs because this lab really incorporated new ideas such as the static_cast, numeric_limits, and trunc. It pushed me to really pull these ideas Iâ€™ve learned in class and implement them into code. I had a hard but fun time doing this lab!

* Lab 8

    Lab 8 part 2 was my last favorite lab because it pushed me to think even further into obtaining user input from the command line to find out a way to skip the first index. I spent an unbelievable amount of time trying to figure out just how to skip the first index of the vector honestly it was a little funny. In the end, I was able to figure it out thank god and was really happy with the result.
